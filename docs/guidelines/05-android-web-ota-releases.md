# Android, Web, OTA, And Releases

Bright OS version rows use four `version_type_id` values: `apk`, `build`, `release`, `canon`.

- `build_versions.version` is an integer counter scoped to `version_type_id`.
- The public app version is assembled as `canon.release.build.apk` from the latest counters; missing `canon` or `release` is `0`.
- Accepted `codex/*` work records one `build` row only.
- `release` rows are created only by explicit command; a release links all unlinked `build` rows and the current `apk` row through `included_in_version_id`.
- `canon` rows are created only by explicit command; a canon links all unlinked `release` rows through `included_in_version_id`.
- APK rows are created only when a shipped APK is built.
- Visible `build_versions.short_changes`, `build_versions.detailed_changes`, and `build_versions.reason` text is written in Russian.
- Branch names, commits, domains, and deploy metadata belong in `build_version_refs` or `deployment_records`, not visible release-note text.

Build and publish a release APK only when native Android code, Capacitor config, permissions, signing, manifest values, application id, SDK versions, icons, splash assets, native plugins, or native compatibility boundaries change.

Release APK signing is env-only. Required variables:

- `BRIGHT_OS_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH`
- `BRIGHT_OS_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD`
- `BRIGHT_OS_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- `BRIGHT_OS_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`

Do not commit APKs, OTA bundles, release pages, keystores, signing passwords, or generated deploy output.
