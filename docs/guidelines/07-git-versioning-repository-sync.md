# Git, Versioning, And Repository Sync

## Branch Classes

- `main` - production source.
- `dev` - shared development source.
- `codex/*` - task branches with preview slots.

`codex/*` pushes deploy to an allocated preview slot (`a.test` through `e.test`) with that slot's web shell, API service, SQLite data path, and mobile OTA endpoint. Production apps and `dev.brightos.world` are not updated until the branch is accepted into `dev` or promoted to `main`.

Preview deployments are review environments, not accepted build versions. They record deployment metadata in `deployment_records`, but their visible app/web version must stay on the current accepted `dev` version with a preview OTA bundle suffix. A new public build version becomes real only after the change is accepted into `dev` and `deploy-dev` succeeds.

Before the first project-file change for a task, branch from the latest accepted base. Ordinary future task work starts from `origin/dev` unless another base is explicitly requested.

Read-only questions, planning, and investigation without project-file changes do not need a branch or preview slot.

Implementation work that changes project files is not complete until the task branch is pushed, CI/deploy has assigned or reused a preview slot, and the user-facing handoff names the preview letter and URL. If all five preview slots are occupied, the branch is queued for the next released slot; report the queued status and position/source if available, but do not describe the task as complete until a slot letter and URL exist.

## Commit And Push

Implementation tasks must finish with a clean tracked working tree.

If a task changes project files, commit the intended tracked changes and push the task branch before handing work back, unless the user explicitly requested planning only, local-only work, no commit, or no push.

For Bright OS `codex/*` task branches, pushing to `origin` and triggering the preview deployment is part of the standing CI/CD workflow approved by the project owner. Do not ask for a separate per-task push confirmation for ordinary implementation work. If the execution environment still blocks the push or deploy, report the exact blocker and leave the task marked incomplete.

Before commit:

- check current branch;
- inspect `git status --short`;
- stage only intended files;
- do not revert unrelated changes;
- run or report relevant checks.

If checks fail or an external blocker prevents commit, push, or preview deploy, report the exact branch, tracked status, failing check or deploy step, and next command instead of implying the task is complete. A full preview pool is a queue state, not a failed task; keep monitoring or report the queued state when the current turn cannot wait.

Ignored generated files may remain local. Do not commit runtime data, build output, signing material, local caches, or generated deploy artifacts.

## GitHub CLI In Codex

Codex sandbox network restrictions can make `gh auth status` falsely report a GitHub CLI login
failure. Before asking the user to re-authenticate, rerun the same `gh` command with network access
outside the sandbox. Treat authentication as broken only if the outside-sandbox check also fails.

## Public Baseline

The public repository starts from a clean baseline history. Do not push old private/bootstrap history, runtime artifacts, generated deploy output, signing material, databases, or personal notes.
