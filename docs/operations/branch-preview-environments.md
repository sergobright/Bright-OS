# Branch Preview Environments

Bright OS uses one VPS for seven environments:

- Production: `app.brightos.world`, branch `main`;
- Dev: `dev.brightos.world`, branch `dev`;
- Preview A-E: `a.test.brightos.world` through `e.test.brightos.world`, branches `codex/*`;
- Preview status: `previews.brightos.world`.

## Agent Flow

Read-only questions, planning, investigation without project-file changes, and environment setup outside the project do not need a branch or preview slot. Before the first project-file change for a new task, start from `origin/dev` and create `codex/<task-slug>` unless the project owner explicitly chooses another branch/base.

Agents must not reuse an existing unrelated `codex/*` branch just because it is the current checkout. Direct follow-ups may continue the same branch, and explicit project-owner branch instructions override the default.

A pushed `codex/*` branch allocates or reuses a preview slot through `deploy/scripts/preview-slots.sh`, deploys that slot, and reports the slot URL. If all slots `A` through `E` are occupied, the branch enters the preview queue until a slot is released. No push means no slot/deploy/queue.

Local dev server URLs are agent-only verification aids. The user-facing handoff for project changes is the preview slot URL after `deploy-preview` succeeds; if CI/deploy is not complete, report that blocker instead of asking the project owner to open `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

For implementation tasks, the final response must include the preview letter (`A` through `E`), preview URL, branch, and commit. If the preview letter or URL is missing because every slot is occupied, the response must say the branch is queued and include queue position/source when available. If it is missing for any other reason, the response must say exactly which push, CI, or deploy step blocked it. Ordinary `codex/*` branch push/deploy is standing Bright OS CI/CD automation and must not be treated as an optional manual confirmation step.

Preview acceptance flow:

```text
codex/* accepted -> merge into dev -> deploy dev -> release preview slot
dev accepted     -> merge into main -> production release/deploy
```

The development repository default branch should be `dev` once `dev` exists. If `dev` is missing during the first accepted preview, bootstrap it from the latest accepted workflow/source commit, set GitHub default branch to `dev`, then merge the accepted `codex/*` branch into `dev` through a PR so the normal promotion and slot-release jobs run.

## Required GitHub Settings

Repository variables:

- `BRIGHT_DEPLOY_HOST` - VPS host or DNS name;
- `BRIGHT_DEPLOY_USER` - deploy user, for example `bright-deploy`;
- `BRIGHT_DEPLOY_SSH_PORT` - optional, defaults to `22`;
- `BRIGHT_DEPLOY_REPO` - optional, defaults to `/srv/projects/bright-os`.

Repository secret:

- `BRIGHT_DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` - private key for the deploy user. Do not commit it or write it into docs.

## Deploy User Boundary

The deploy user needs write access to `/srv/projects/bright-os-envs/` for CI uploads,
prod/dev/preview source checkouts, dev/preview web/OTA outputs, SQLite deployment metadata, and preview slot state.
For production deploys it also needs write access to the existing production web/OTA targets and
Timer SQLite file:

```text
/srv/projects/bright-os/deploy/web
/srv/projects/bright-os/deploy/mobile-update
/srv/projects/bright-os/data/bright_timer.sqlite
/srv/projects/bright-os/data/bright_timer.sqlite-wal when present
/srv/projects/bright-os/data/bright_timer.sqlite-shm when present
```

The deploy user must not need read or write access to `/srv/projects/bright-os/.git`. Sudo should be limited to:

```text
caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
systemctl reload caddy
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api.service
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api-dev.service
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api-preview-a.service
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api-preview-b.service
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api-preview-c.service
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api-preview-d.service
systemctl restart brightos-timer-api-preview-e.service
```

The Ansible sudoers template is `deploy/ansible/templates/brightos-deploy-sudoers.j2`.

## Server Setup

Run Ansible as `root` or another server admin account with full `become`, not as the limited CI deploy user. The playbook creates `bright-deploy`; add the CI public SSH key to that user outside source.

Dry run:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i deploy/ansible/inventory.example.ini deploy/ansible/bright-os.yml --check --diff
```

Apply after check mode passes and secrets/env files exist on the VPS:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i deploy/ansible/inventory.example.ini deploy/ansible/bright-os.yml
```

The current local VPS setup keeps the existing production service name `brightos-timer-api.service`.
Prod, dev, and preview services run from the source checkout uploaded into
`/srv/projects/bright-os-envs/<environment>/source/services/timer_api` as the configured service user/group.
The limited `bright-deploy` user owns `/srv/projects/bright-os-envs`, publishes only the deployment
artifacts above, and uses sudo only for Caddy validation, Caddy reload, and matching Timer API service restarts.

Non-production Caddy routes keep the app shell protected with the unified Caddy Basic Auth login, but
`/mobile-update/*` stays public for Android OTA and `/api/*` is proxied to the matching Timer API without
Caddy Basic Auth or injected bearer headers. Timer API auth remains responsible for `/v1/*` data access,
so newly installed Dev/A-E apps may need their own in-app login session before sync turns green.

If an environment exists before its first CI deploy, publish a baseline web/OTA layer without changing APK
versions:

```bash
BRIGHT_OS_MIN_APK_VERSION_CODE=1 deploy/scripts/publish-environment-web-layer.sh dev preview-b preview-c preview-d preview-e
```

Ansible templates do not store passwords, Caddy auth hashes, deploy keys, Android signing secrets, or Timer API secrets. Per-environment Timer API secret env files live outside source under:

```text
/srv/projects/bright-os-envs/<environment>/timer-api.env
```

## Public Branch Protection

After the clean public repository has its initial public `main`, configure GitHub branch protection/ruleset for public `main`:

- require pull requests;
- require status checks from `Bright OS public main CI`;
- require `node scripts/check-public-branch.mjs`;
- block direct pushes;
- block force pushes;
- block branch deletion.

The public guard is required for `main`, `dev`, pull requests, and `codex/*` branches in the clean public repository.
