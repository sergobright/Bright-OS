## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change migrate-to-next-capacitor-local-first. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Next.js is the primary client platform
Brai SHALL use a Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS client as the primary product UI for future web and Android app work.

#### Scenario: Web UI is implemented

#### Scenario: Android APK is built
- **WHEN** the Android APK is built
- **THEN** it packages the same product UI and feature modules used by the web build
- **AND** Android-specific behavior is isolated behind platform adapters or native plugins

#### Scenario: New native capability is required

- **THEN** the feature requires an APK update
- **AND** the native dependency is documented before release

### Requirement: Responsive app UI is designed mobile-first
The Next.js client SHALL treat narrow Android phone viewports as a primary supported layout.

#### Scenario: Motion title transition source is required before use
